  <h1 class="text-center mt-5">How event loop  works in Javascript</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives more tasks.</li>
    <li> The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty </li>
    <li>A thread, the function at the top of the stack is what's currently running. The event loop is at the bottom of the stack</li>
    <li> An event loop is often the main loop in a program that typically waits for the user to trigger something</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 class="text-center mt-5">How many ways are there to get undefined </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>When a variable has not been assigned a value then we see undefined</li>
    <li>A function returns undefined if a value was not returned </li>
    <li>There is a variable or constant which is not set.</li>
    <li>A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value</li>
  </ul>
